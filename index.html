Thanks so much for your interest in the Ithaca Queer Kink Party. First, a bit about us</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This group was formed around a desire for a kink space that is for trans and queer folks. We are intentionally creating a play space that centers and prioritizes experiences and bodies that are marginalized in many kink and play spaces, including trans women, fat folks, dykes, and low- income folks without access to expensive gear. None of the invitees are cis-het folks. 

Thus far the group has been active via semi-regular play parties and a Discord, but future events could include munches (public gatherings at restaurants), sloshes (public gatherings where alcohol is available), educational events, and more. The goal is for different participants to share the administrative responsibilities of planning and hosting events, so if you want a specific kind of event, get involved and then you can help make it happen! 

Each party will have its own rules and guidelines. This document is not meant to include or replace that information. This is just how to join in or invite someone new.</p> 

<h2>How to join in</h2>
<p>From the start vetting has been an intentionally slow process of personal networks to grow organically with a strong sense of community and accountability. 

To continue centering trans and queer folks, please only invite or seek invitations for members who identify as queer or trans. 

We’ve been branching one person out from a trusted person based on their recommendation. For example, person X who I know and trust has vouched for person Y, so person Y is able to come, but person Y can’t invite additional guests until their attendance at an event happens and goes well. Once they’ve met more folks involved, then they become eligible to invite someone that they know, trust, and are willing to vouch for.

Here’s a persistent link to the Discord:</p>
